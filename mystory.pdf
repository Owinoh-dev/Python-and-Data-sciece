# Why I choose Python as my favorite language for Data science

#What you need to know

Guido van Rossum introduced Python back in 1991. It has since become an extremely popular general purpose language, and is widely used within the data science community. The major versions are currently 3.6 and 2.7.

#Pros
-Python is a very popular, mainstream general purpose programming language. It has an extensive range of purpose-built modules and community support. Many online services provide a Python API.

-Python is an easy language to learn. The low barrier to entry makes it an ideal first language for those new to programming.
Packages such as pandas, scikit-learn and Tensorflow make Python a solid option for advanced machine learning applications.

#Cons
Type safety: Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you must show due care. Type errors (such as passing a String as an argument to a method which expects an Integer) are to be expected from time-to-time.

For specific statistical and data analysis purposes, R’s vast range of packages gives it a slight edge over Python. For general purpose languages, there are faster and safer alternatives to Python.

#Verdict — “excellent all-rounder”
Python is a very good choice of language for data science, and not just at entry-level. Much of the data science process revolves around the ETL process(extraction-transformation-loading). This makes Python’s generality ideally suited. Libraries such as Google’s Tensorflow make Python a very exciting language to work in for machine learning.
